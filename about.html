      <p>I infuse my life at all levels with community building and social change. My strong interpersonal skills and
        passion for learning trickle over into many areas of my life. My education, past volunteer and work experience
        in the customer service field and in the non-profit sector would be perfectly suited for the position. </p>

      <p>Currently, I am enrolled in a two-year program at Algonquin College taking Interactive Media Design. I have
        taken courses in photography, responsive web design, and digital graphics. I am also familiar with client-side
        web development, content management systems, videography and user experience design. I am a creative type with
        a solid understanding of UX / UI design principles, as well as video editing and post-production skills. I have
        had the chance to fine-tune my skills in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Premiere Pro. I have
        developed responsive design for web-based content and I have experience using WordPress, Drupal and Joomla!.</p>

      <p>As a freelance media designer I have had the opportunity to work alongside clients to define, design, develop
        and deploy a wide array of projects. Iâ€™ve worked with the Migrant Resource Centre Canada, Cloud Forest Coffee,
        designing and deploying WordPress websites, directing, producing, and editing product videos for marketing.</p>

      <p>I am a team player who has worked in a wide array of sectors in society and my professional skill sets can be
        applied in many contexts. I would love to meet with you to discuss more in depth my qualifications and how they
        will meet your needs. Thank-you for taking the time to read my application. I look forward to hearing back from
        you.</p>
