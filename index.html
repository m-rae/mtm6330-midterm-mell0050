        <img class="intro_image" src="./img/montanamellettresize.jpg" alt="Creator of the MM Design, Montana Mellett. ">
        <p>My name is Montana Mellett, a media designer currently studying at Algonquin College school of Media and
          Design. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Arts in International Development Studies from Trent
          University. This experience also included a year abroad in Ecuador doing community development at the
          Universidad de Andina Simon Bolivar.</p>

        <p>My range of studies and life experience helps me bring a different perspective to my design. I excel in
          graphics, user experience, and responsive web design. I tell stories with my camera and inspire connection
          with my words. Let me tell your story with captivating visuals, a clean brand, and a responsive website!</p>
